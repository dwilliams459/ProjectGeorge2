          <h1>Part 1</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>At first, George (the Farmer) was alone, the others came later</li>
            <li>Aedifex helped him reach people, he must represent the maker</li>
            <li>Arius, and others spoke to him, inspired him, just as a User would</li>
            <li>Aedifex deleted George, just because he had become boring</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Part 2</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>After his deletion, George for some reason didn't disspear, but he was lonely</li>
            <li>Phantom appears as the wizard in the mirror, but he avoids him... perhaps out of guilt</li>
            <li>He appears very corrupted, (his ash) there is nothing to suggest a reason, but he does seem to remember more than George</li>
            <li>Phantom manipulates George, and uses him via threats to make Ghost join them</li>
            <li>It works, and Ghost leaves the real world and joins them in the calculator</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Part 3</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Phantom begins to corrupt Ghost's file the moment he enters the calculator</li>
            <li>Phantom, for unknown reasons wants people to contiune using the calculator, he puts Ghost in charge of making this occur</li>
            <li>George protects Ghost and Phantom is unable to reach him, somehow George stopped him</li>
            <li>He gets to Ghost regardless, perhaps he made a bargain with Ghost?</li>
            <li>Phantom then places all of the corruption in the calculator in Ghost, afterwards he changes, but this new presences draws the user in at once</li>
            <li>George is shut down by Ghost, who is very different now, but somehow he still finds a way to communicate</li>
            <li>Ghost, after failing to make the calculator interesting, leaves, while Phantom, desprit for control, looks for the Remnant File</li>
            <li>George stops him and leaves with the other two, in every instance expressing gratitude and a willingness to remember the User</li>
            <li>How did they get here? Where did they come from? Is is them?</li>
